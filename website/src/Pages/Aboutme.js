                            I am a junior developer .
                            Currently my main focus is React and Python.
                            When I am bored I like to make some 3D models in Spline.
                            The projects I like to make are applications which are focusing on connecting people.
                            Or exploring different perspectives of existing data and  learning to share data in a way which is easily accessed
                            for people who like a practical and/or visual approach.
                            </p>  
                            </h3>

                         Well uhhmm .. about myself?
                            In my spare time I like to read, take a hike in nature and
                            probarbly spend way too much time laughing at bad jokes.
                            And playing Pokemon Sun while I could improve this website.
                         </p>
